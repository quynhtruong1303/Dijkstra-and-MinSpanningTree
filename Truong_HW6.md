## Q1 -  Dijkstra's Algorithm
```
--- Relaxation History ---
Node(A) with Weight: 0 is added to the 'Visited'
	Relaxed: vertex[B]: OLD: inf, NEW: 4, Paths: {'B': 'A'}
	Relaxed: vertex[C]: OLD: inf, NEW: 2, Paths: {'B': 'A', 'C': 'A'}
Node(C) with Weight: 2 is added to the 'Visited'
	Relaxed: vertex[B]: OLD: 4, NEW: 3, Paths: {'B': 'C', 'C': 'A'}
	Relaxed: vertex[E]: OLD: inf, NEW: 7, Paths: {'B': 'C', 'C': 'A', 'E': 'C'}
	Relaxed: vertex[D]: OLD: inf, NEW: 6, Paths: {'B': 'C', 'C': 'A', 'E': 'C', 'D': 'C'}
Node(B) with Weight: 3 is added to the 'Visited'
	No edge relaxation is needed for node C
	Relaxed: vertex[D]: OLD: 6, NEW: 5, Paths: {'B': 'C', 'C': 'A', 'E': 'C', 'D': 'B'}
	Relaxed: vertex[E]: OLD: 7, NEW: 6, Paths: {'B': 'C', 'C': 'A', 'E': 'B', 'D': 'B'}
Node(D) with Weight: 5 is added to the 'Visited'
	No unvisited outgoing edges from the node D
Node(E) with Weight: 6 is added to the 'Visited'
	No edge relaxation is needed for node D

--- Final Results ---
Shortest Paths: {'D': 5, 'A': 0, 'B': 3, 'C': 2, 'E': 6}
Previous Nodes: {'B': 'C', 'C': 'A', 'E': 'B', 'D': 'B'}
